# Task Runner v1.0.3 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 18 January 2026
**Version:** 1.0.3  
**Status:** Enhancement Release  

## 🎉 Overview

Task Runner v1.0.3 introduces support for orchestrator tasks - tasks with no commands that serve to group and coordinate dependencies. This enhancement allows you to create cleaner workflow definitions by having tasks that exist purely to orchestrate other tasks.

## ✨ Enhancements

### Orchestrator Tasks Support
- **Added**: Tasks can now have empty commands if they have dependencies
- **Impact**: Enables cleaner workflow organization by creating tasks that exist purely to coordinate other tasks
- **Use Case**: Perfect for creating high-level task groupings like `check`, `deploy`, or `dev` that run multiple related tasks
- **Implementation**: 
  - Validation now allows tasks with empty `commands` array if they have `dependencies`
  - Tasks with empty commands and no dependencies will still fail validation (must have at least one or the other)
  - Execution handles orchestrator tasks gracefully - they complete successfully once all dependencies finish

### Validation Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Task validation now recognizes orchestrator tasks as valid
- **Impact**: Users can now define tasks that serve as workflow orchestrators without needing placeholder commands
- **Example**: A `check` task can now have `"commands": []` and `"dependencies": ["lint", "format", "test"]` to run all checks

## 📦 What's Included

This release includes:
- Support for orchestrator tasks (tasks with dependencies but no commands)
- Improved task validation to allow empty commands for dependency-only tasks
- Enhanced workflow organization capabilities
- All features and functionality from v1.0.2 remain unchanged

## 🚀 Installation

### From NPM
```bash
npm install -g task-runner@1.0.3
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zemerik/task-runner.git
cd task-runner
git checkout v1.0.3
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## 🔄 Upgrading from v1.0.2

No code changes required. Simply update to the new version:

```bash
npm install -g task-runner@1.0.3
```

Or rebuild from source if installing manually.

## 📋 Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**: Yes - fully compatible with v1.0.2
- **Configuration Files**: No changes required - existing configs work as before
- **API**: No breaking changes
- **Behavior Changes**: 
  - Tasks with empty commands and dependencies are now valid (orchestrator tasks)
  - Tasks with empty commands and no dependencies will now fail validation with a clearer error message

## 🧪 Testing

All existing tests pass. The enhancement ensures that:
- Orchestrator tasks (empty commands, has dependencies) are valid
- Regular tasks (has commands) continue to work as before
- Tasks with neither commands nor dependencies are properly rejected
- Execution of orchestrator tasks completes successfully after dependencies finish

## 💡 Example Usage

### Orchestrator Task Example

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "lint": {
      "description": "Run linting",
      "commands": ["npm run lint"]
    },
    "format": {
      "description": "Format code",
      "commands": ["npm run format"]
    },
    "test": {
      "description": "Run tests",
      "commands": ["npm test"]
    },
    "check": {
      "description": "Run all checks",
      "dependencies": ["lint", "format", "test"],
      "commands": []
    }
  }
}
```

Running `task-runner run check` will execute `lint`, `format`, and `test` in dependency order, and then the `check` task itself will complete successfully (no commands to run).

### Complex Orchestration Example

```yaml
tasks:
  build:backend:
    description: Build backend
    commands:
      - "cargo build"
    working_dir: "./backend"
    
  build:frontend:
    description: Build frontend
    commands:
      - "npm run build"
    working_dir: "./frontend"
    
  test:backend:
    description: Test backend
    commands:
      - "cargo test"
    working_dir: "./backend"
    dependencies: ["build:backend"]
    
  test:frontend:
    description: Test frontend
    commands:
      - "npm test"
    working_dir: "./frontend"
    dependencies: ["build:frontend"]
    
  build:
    description: Build everything
    dependencies: ["build:backend", "build:frontend"]
    commands: []
    
  test:
    description: Test everything
    dependencies: ["test:backend", "test:frontend"]
    commands: []
    
  ci:
    description: Run CI pipeline
    dependencies: ["build", "test"]
    commands: []
```

This allows you to run `task-runner run ci` to execute the entire CI pipeline, or `task-runner run build` to build everything, without needing to remember all the individual task names.
